# The version is stored in the .json outputs so future versions can know exactly how to interpret old, outdated data

# Pre-release version info (none of these are actually supported, nor are they publically available):
# 0.1: very old; rudimentary and inconsistent jsons per use case
# 0.2: all mislabeled as 0.1, because I forgot to update this number. generally consistent per use case, but outdated and may not contain all info
# 0.3: now contains layer_index in limb_data

# Release version info:
# 1.0: does not exist yet
